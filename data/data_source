The investigation utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, comprising 60,000 32x32 colored images across ten distinct categories. These categories encompass objects ranging from airplanes to trucks, with a clear demarcation between real and synthetic images. 
The training dataset consists of 80,000 labeled images equally distributed between real and fake categories, while both the validation and test sets comprise 20,000 labeled images each, evenly split between the two classes.
